<!--
- Title: Make sure the title is short, descriptive and useful as commit message when squashing the pull request.
- Description: Write a thorough description, where is it for? Why do we need it? What's the impact? Does it break anything?
- Branch: Target the right branch and create another pull request if it's needed in multiple branches.
- Docs: Should it be documented? Create a pull requests to rapidez/docs. Breaking? Write some upgrade info.
- Tests: Don't forget the tests; they should pass and adding more is always a good idea.

Thanks! ðŸš€
